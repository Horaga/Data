***

For this study, i thought it would be nice to try and see if the Height and/or Weight would affect the medal results of the Olympics competition.
So, firstly I've created scatter plots to see if it would have a significant distribution between the two values of Height and Weight, then after i've found that it didn't had a meaningful value, made it so we could see the distribution for each medal result, giving these plots:

</p>

Then, after seeing those results, it was clear that i would have to relate Height and Weight by their proportion and try to see if these would be significant for any conclusion, so i've got a bar plot which has the information of percentiles of the Means of proportions by each medal, and additionaly has the standard deviation on the whiskers.

After that i could conclude that these values wasn't at all correlated, since there isn't a significant deviation of the medal results, and silver who really deviate the values for the standard deviation surpasses the others medals percentiles, then it could be ther aswell.

Then it would be interesting to see if there's a sports category that has the highest Height and Weight Proportion mean, so it was born this plot:

</p>

This plot shows us that Rythmic Gymnastics has the highest Height and Weight Proportion of all sports categories, perhaps the kind of exercises made could be related to this fact, since it's common to see really thin but still muscular athletes in this category.

Alas pursuing the initial idea, this plot is comparing every mean of medals results by each kind of sport category side by side.

This plot give os more insight of which sports Height and Weight proportion values could have a significant impact, since golden medals where more acquirde by higher values on the sports categories of Golf and Diving.
