For this study, i was interested on seeing the solar incidence of diferent regions of my country Brazil, since the surge of energy generated by solar pannels, i thought this would be a good and valuable data to be seen as clearly as possible.

  
  The first step would be to get the data that i needed, this wouldn't go for long since it was very easy to find it, the data is available to download [here](http://labren.ccst.inpe.br/atlas_2017.html).
  
  
  Now with the data available, a brief of the coding part would proceed as uploading the data as a DataFrame in Pandas, cleanning it and getting the vital information in forms of lists, also creating lists manually to better manipulate this data. The very first graphical plot i would like to make was to see a comparation of every single state on this country, so it would be possible to see in which states where the most solar incidences, so it would have more energy production potential. It's valid to remind that since this is a categorical kind of data, every graph is going to be a bar plot.
  
  <p align = 'center'> Here's the graph that do this comparison</p>

  As expected, this was a very interesting plot since we can actually see which states have a higher average on solar incidence, this can be a decisive information.
  
  Next i would like to see an average of the solar incidence on each state by month, but first and most important i needed to see the solar incidence of one state, which was Distrito Federal, next is the plotting for this average distributed by the months.
    
![Monthly Mean of Solar Incidence on Distrito Federal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101594934/162072852-71ae530c-b26c-4196-881b-0cc1111d2a8d.png)

This plotting was also very useful, in it we can really see the changes in solar incidence because of seasons, this is of ultimate importance for companies that wish to get into the solar pannel business, this data can be used to see predict the fluctuations so their projects can produce energy to supply the low production months.

Then as a matter of curiosity i did a code that would plot every single one of the states by it's month, just as we just saw in the case of Distrito Federal, so here are the plots, and thanks for reading through here.
